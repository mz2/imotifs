 To invoke Java 1.4.1 or the currently preferred JDK as defined by the operating system 
 (1.4.2 as of the release of this sample and the release of Mac OS X 10.4) nothing changes 
 in 10.4 vs 10.3 in that when a JNI_VERSION_1_4 is passed into JNI_CreateJavaVM 
 as the vm_args.version it returns the current preferred JDK.
 
 To specify the current preferred JDK in a family of JVM's, say the 1.5.x family, 
 applications should set the environment variable JAVA_JVM_VERSION to 1.5, 
 and then pass JNI_VERSION_1_4 into JNI_CreateJavaVM as the vm_args.version. 
 To get a specific Java 1.5 JVM, say Java 1.5.0, set the environment variable 
 JAVA_JVM_VERSION to 1.5.0. For Java 1.6 it will be the same in that applications 
 will need to set the environment variable JAVA_JVM_VERSION to 1.6 to specify the 
 current preferred 1.6 Java VM, and to get a specific Java 1.6 JVM, say Java 1.6.1, 
 set the environment variable JAVA_JVM_VERSION to 1.6.1.
 
 To make this sample bring up the current preferred 1.5 JVM, set the environment variable 
 JAVA_JVM_VERSION to 1.5 before calling JNI_CreateJavaVM as shown below. 
 Applications must currently check for availability of JDK 1.5 before requesting it.  
 If your application requires JDK 1.5 and it is not found, it is your responsibility 
 to report an error to the user. To verify if a JVM is installed, check to see if the symlink, 
 or directory exists for the JVM in /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/ 
 before setting the environment variable JAVA_JVM_VERSION.
 
 If the environment variable JAVA_JVM_VERSION is not set, and JNI_VERSION_1_4 is passed into 
 JNI_CreateJavaVM as the vm_args.version, JNI_CreateJavaVM will return the current preferred JDK. 
 Java 1.4.2 is the preferred JDK as of the release of this sample and the release of Mac OS X 10.4.
