iMotifs – sequence motif editor for the Mac
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

iMotifs is a powerful yet easy to use sequence motif viewer and editor for the Apple Mac computers. 
It is a research tool for computational biologists that allows viewing, editing and analysing XMS formatted 
sequence motif set files (position weight matrices).

Here’s a list of the major features:

Viewing and editing
- - - - - - - - - -
    * View sequence logos for motifs
    * Annotate motifs with freeform metadata (e.g. notes, TRANSFAC accessions, etc)
    * Rename motifs easily either individually or in batch (add prefixes, suffixes)
    * Add pseudocounts to motifs
    * Reverse complement motifs
    * PDF output
    * Printing support
    * Search by motif name or consensus sequence
    * QuickLook plugin for viewing motif files with Finder and other QuickLook supporting applications (e.g. the Cyberduck SFTP client)
    * Drag & Drop motifs between motif sets in iMotifs, or to Finder

Analysis tools
- - - - - - - 
    * Integrated NestedMICA motif inference and analysis toolkit with no outside dependencies
    * Find closest matching or reciprocally matching motif pairs between motif sets (distance metric from Down et al, 2007)
    * Present motif multiple alignments
    * Calculate motif multiple alignments
    * Drag in sequence FASTA files to discover sequence motifs with NestedMICA (uses an integrated NestedMICA motif discovery tool)
    * NestedMICA sequence background model training
    * Motif overrepresentation scoring between two sets of sequences (Down et al, 2007)
    * Motif significance score cutoff assignment (Down et al, 2007)
    * It’s multithreaded: you can keep working on motifs whilst multiple alignments or motif-motif matches are being computed.
