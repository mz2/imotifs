=head1 NAME

Motif - Perl extension for creating DNA motifs in XMS format

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Motif;

 my $motif = Motif->new($wm,$name,$threshold)   # $wm is weightmatrix, $name is name of the motif and $threshold is the threshold values.
 $motif->toXML()         # Create motifs in XMS format
 $motif->toString()      #  Create motifs in string/xms format



=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Motif package can be used to crrate the XMS format for a given set of motifs, their asscoiated weightmatrices and threshold values.


=head2 EXPORT

None by default.
