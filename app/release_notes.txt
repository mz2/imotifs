h3. 0.2.6 - More error dialogs instead of crashes for error situations

* Some more error situations covered in file loading and with launching external analysis tools.

Please send feedback, questions, ideas to imotifs@googlegroups.com or matias.piipari@gmail.com!

h3. 0.2.5 - Major revisions: motif scanning + sequence feature viewing support

* Error handling improved: analysis tools will not let you run or copy to clipboard before all required arguments have been included.
* Warning messages added to the motif inference configuration dialog to warn about long-running tasks.
* Packaged as a 32-bit universal binary, including all the dependent libraries that are packaged with iMotifs.
* Motif scanning: run nmscan on a set of sequences, then view the motif hits on the sequence.
* FASTA sequence support (BioCocoa's FASTA parser is used). 
* GFF file support: a sortable table is shown for sequence features.

h3. 0.2.4 - User suggested to run NMICA as a batch job for large computations, bug fixes to reciprocal matching

* Motif discovery configuration dialog now suggests running the task as a batch job with the assistance of 'Copy to clipboard' and Terminal, when the user has specified  more than 200 sequences and/or more than 10 motifs.
* Bug fixes to reciprocal matching: progress indication added back, temporary file handling improved.
* Added BioCocoa.framework to iMotifs (universal binary)

h3. 0.2.3 - Combined generic sequence feature and sequencing peak retrieval to one dialog

* Added GFF as a possible input format to the ChIP-seq peak retrieval tool and renamed it to "Retrieve sequence features from Ensembl"

h2. 0.2.2 - Background training, plus bug fixes

* Added a GUI for the NMICA background training tool: Analysis -> Train NMICA background model...

h2. 0.2.1 - New analysis tools, plus bug fixes

* Bug fixes to sequence retrieal
* ChIP-seq peak sequence retrieval added
* Motif cutoff assignment tool added
* Motif overrepresentation scoring tool added

h2. 0.2.0 - Usability fix to sequence retrieval dialog 

Searching / specifying a gene ID list in the sequence retrieval dialog are now mutually exclusive


h2. 0.1.9 - Bug fixes in the sequence retrieval process handling

Bug fix: Sequence retrieval from Ensembl caused a crash.

h2. 0.1.8 - Sequence retrieval, motif alignment + merging, flexible motif column width/height

Some new features such as Ensembl based sequence retrieval, motif alignment and merging, and flexible motif column width/height assignment, plus some of the old bugs too.

Sorry for the long delay in updating the build! The build process has been streamlined and you should therefore expect more frequent updates from now on.

h2. 0.1.7 - Motif alignment works with selected motifs / all motifs

Motif alignments can be now done either for only selected motifs or all motifs (when none are selected). 

h2. 0.1.6 - Test release for the Sparkle updates

Just testing the Sparkle signing.

h2. 0.1.5 - iMotifs with built-in NMICA

NestedMICA is now built into the iMotifs application package. That is, you don't need a separate installation of NMICA to do motif discovery with iMotifs!

h2. 0.1.0 - First public development release of iMotifs

This is the first public release of iMotifs. Expect bugs, crashes and malfunction of all kind. Please report any bugs you find to <a>matias@piipari.net</a>.
